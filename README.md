2020 NBA finals coverage
Welcome to Ballers 
This page was created to have full coverage of the NBA 2020 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers from the Western Conference and the Miami Heat from the Eastern Conference. The Lakers led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis look to win it all and gain their 17th championship which would tie them for all-time championships at first with the Boston Celtics. However the Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler with their grit and grind mentality hope to win their 4th championship. Many have counted out the Heat from the Finals, though they have several young players under great guidance they have made it to the finals while only losing 3 games in the total 15 games they have played in the playoffs. The Lakers however title favorites led by the considered best basketball player in the NBA right now have also lost 3 games on the path to the finals out of 15 total games played on the path to the Finals. These historic playoffs played at Orlando in the first ever bubble playoffs with no at attendance fans are a great show down between two great teams.
